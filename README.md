# Sharpduino
Arduino Leonardo based replacement cassette interface for the Sharp/Radio Shack Pocket Computers

Following the success of the CIduino7, I plan to develop a similar Arduino interface for the Sharp/Radio Shack pocket computers to save tape files directly without the need for audio conversion. I will start by implementing it for my trusty Sharp EL-5500III. Fortunately I have the CE-129P to sample audio and the Pocket-Tools documentation to work out the modulation protocol.
